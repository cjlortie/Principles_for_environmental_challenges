abstract: >
  An environmental management challenge is an opportunity to use fundamental science to inform evidence-based decisions for  environmental stakeholders and conservationists.  Contemporary science is embracing open science and increasingly conscious of reproduciblility.  Synergistically, applying these two paradigms in concert advances our capacity to move beyond context dependency and singlular thinking to reverse engineer solutions from published scientific evidence associated with one challenge to many. Herein, we provide a short list of principles that can guide those that seek solutions to address environmental management through primary scientific literature.
