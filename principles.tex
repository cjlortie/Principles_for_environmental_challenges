\section*{Abstract}
An environmental management challenge is an opportunity to use
fundamental science to inform evidence-based decisions for environmental
stakeholders and conservationists. Contemporary science is embracing
open science and increasingly conscious of reproduciblility.
Synergistically, applying these two paradigms in concert advances our
capacity to move beyond context dependency and singlular thinking to
reverse engineer solutions from published scientific evidence associated
with one challenge to many. Herein, we provide a short list of
principles that can guide those that seek solutions to address
environmental management through primary scientific literature.

Grand challenges require grand solutions. Environmental management
cannot neglect fundamental science as a substrate for effective decision
making, and scientists should be conscious of how their science can be

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Conservation decisions can reside with legislators (indirect impactors)
or environmental managers (direct impactors). To focus on the latter,
managers typically have scientific backgrounds and routinely navigate
the technical literature. However, engagement with scientific literature
is non-trivial for all practitioners because of time, access, relevance
of the science, and reporting standards. Environmental managers and
conservationists should seek to use evidence to inform decisions
{[}1,2{]}. However, there can be a gap in communication between basic
science and management for at least three reasons. Firstly, the research
is not a direct study of an ecosystem, and an immediate, real-world
solution is needed by managers - preferably with a demonstrable outcome
and reasonable cost estimate {[}3,4{]}. This is a very real limitation
in the primary science literature restoration ecology for instance
{[}5{]}. Secondly, the link between the biology or ecology present in
the literature is not articulately connected to the similar process for
the system at hand. There are notable examples with journals just as the
Journal of Applied Ecology, Basic and Applied Ecology, the Journal of
Environmental Engineering, and many others, but there nonetheless
remains a vast pool of opportunity for solution development in other
journals. Context-specific findings in science are a legitimate and
useful means to advance discovery, but at times, studies from one system
can be re-purposed for insights into another. Finally, the capacity to
see the forest for the trees or the generality of a specific, even
large-scale or broad basic research study can be a challenge. Science
can be very specialized {[}{\textbf{???}}{]}, and mobilizing knowledge
for solutions requires both detailed expertise, scientific synthesis
tools {[}6{]}, or a focus on identifying the salient elements associated
with a study {[}7,8{]}. Often, seeing the forest also requires sampling
many trees. This leads to the general proposal here that experts can
promote reproducible and mobile knowledge for many fundamental science
endeavors by considering these principles. This is both a set of
principles for how to make your research potentially reusable by
environmental managers and conservationists {[}9{]} and inform solutions
for the environmental crisis.

An environmental management challenge is a problem presented in
scientific literature or society that, when redefined and reviewed using
these 10 principles, can result in a solution to the original problem.
EXPAND\ldots{} a tiny bit more..how. Typically, a challenge is\ldots{}.
look up how they define grand challenges and make mention here including
the 17 global sustainability goals. A (reverse-engineered) reproducible
solution is a suggested solution to a challenge derived from identifying
all the components of the challenge. It should be applicable to multiple
local-extent challenges when tweaked to fit the circumstances. Finally,
a tool or solution is the desired outcome from the primary research to
support evidence-based decision making in conservation. In this case, a
tool is a methodology researchers use that can facilitate managers to
either identify best ways to measure/identify issues or to provide
solutions for their specific challenge. Any tool is linked to its
respective reproducible solution by the fundamental concepts of
reproducibility {[}{\textbf{???}}{]}. These can include primarily
conceptual replication but also\ldots{}. check papers on
reproducibility. then concluding sentence.

The heuristic developed here was inspired by the ``Ten Simple Rules''
format pioneered by Phillip Bourne in the field of computational biology
{[}10{]}. We propose that by distilling the concepts that promote
engagement with scientific literature outside of the research community,
managers can rely on broader sources of scientific knowledge to make
decisions. Additionally, researchers can better understand the
perspective of managers facilitating science and scientific
communication that is more applicable to managers without compromising
their research programs. Here, we will outline and discuss simple
``principles'' scientists can use to make their research more applicable
to managers, and managers can use to identify basic science that fits
their needs.

\section{The principles}\label{the-principles}

\textbf{1. Reframe the problem as challenge.} Doom-and-gloom is a
pervasive mentality in ecology and environmental sciences which can
reduce productivity and problem solving. It can shut down even the most
motivated of minds--but beyond the issue of motivation, reframing a
problem as a \emph{challenge} can reveal solution sets that may
otherwise remain hidden. For example, consider the problem of
human-wildlife conflict between carnivores and the people living near
the Ruaha National Park boundary in Tanzania. The \emph{problem} is that
98.5\% of people perceive wildlife as a threat to their livestock
resulting in increased likelihoods for human-wildlife conflict {[}11{]}.
Re-framed, the challenge can be to decrease the negative perception of
wildlife in areas with high human-wildlife conflict opportunities. It is
a small change in semantics, but it is a potentially profound change in
direction.

\textbf{2. Describe the scope and extent of the challenge.} Defining the
scope of a challenge conceptually and the extent geographically will
ensure that potential solutions fit the challenge. Moving across scales
is a common issue in ecology {[}12{]}, and proposing a spatial scale,
using common terms, and describing the breadth of the challenge will
accelerate interdisciplinary solutions (i.e.~the wildlife-human
challenge above is ecological and societal). The challenge can be
problematic on multiple scales including local, regional, or global
scale and solutions can be needed for each. Conceptually, the scope is
broad in the human-wildlife conflict example whilst the extent is
primarily local to the area surrounding the Southern border of the Ruaha
National Park.

\textbf{3. Explicitly link the basic science to management implications
and policy.} Perhaps the most facile principle, a simple description and
definition of the basic scientific evidence in a study and how it can be
reused is a fundamental step in linking science to evidence-based
decision making for environmental challenges. In the wildlife-human
challenge, depredation of livestock impacted 61.1\% of households, but
livestock loss due to disease or theft was X percent? of total loss
{[}11{]}. Consequently, a clear statement of evidence can illuminate the
most viable solution sets in some instances.

\textbf{4. Propose implications of ignoring this challenge.} A
description of the impact a challenge on a system if left unchecked will
help clarify the severity of the challenge. The trickle down effects and
indirect implications of the challenge should also be examined. For
instance, anti-carnivore sentiment will likely only grow as climate
change and pressures to confine pastoral herders makes livestock more
difficult to raise {[}13,14{]}. Many large carnivores are already
threatened/endangered, and further anthropogenic pressures on the
populations will lead to severe declines in populations including
potential extinction of keystone species {[}15--17{]}; but it is often
associated with underlying human-human conflict {[}18{]}.

\textbf{5. State the direct human needs associated with this challenge.}
State the direct needs of humans as part of the process of generating
reproducible solutions for environmental challenges. The intrinsic value
of the ecosystem is impossible to quantify {[}19{]}, but linking the
challenge and its solutions to direct human needs makes it less likely
to be dismissed. Identifying anthropogenic needs will help a problem
solver create a solution that is appropriate for the challenge, and it
can also prevent the emergence of new related challenges or pressures on
the system in question. This principle can also include engagement with
stakeholders as a mechanism to inform benefits and solutions
{[}20,21{]}.

\textbf{6. List at least one limitation of the study and explain.} There
is no perfect experiment {[}{\textbf{???}}{]} or synthesis {[}22{]}.
Critically reading the study associated with the challenge can mean the
difference between success and failure of a later implemented management
solution that otherwise follows all other principles presented here. A
clear analysis of causation and correlation can help avoid a fatal
misstep and ensures effective framing of expected outcomes with an
environmental intervention for conservationists. This is not to say that
interventions need always be cause-effect studies or that evidence-based
decisions cannot be made with compelling preliminary evidence or
mensurative data. We are simply proposing that a statement of the
relative strength of evidence and gaps in the research provides a future
direction for additional research and for implementation.

\textbf{7. Explore the benefits of minimal intervention for
stakeholders.} Resources are limiting, and at times, the
business-as-usual model can provide a guide to intervention for some
environmental management challenges {[}{\textbf{???}},23{]}. At the
minimum, exploration of a hope for the best strategy or minimal
intervention is critical because of costs. Business-as-usual models can
also provide an economic mechanism to value ecosystems services
{[}24,25{]}, and whilst this is not without debate, this can expand the
breath of stakeholders and potential investors in a solution for a
particular challenge. A best and worst case scenario analysis is also
likely a frequent need for many environmental challenges because of
inertia in the structures that we use to manage people and resources.

\textbf{8. List the tools applied to this challenge.} In an
environmental management challenge case study, there is typically at
least one primary tool that the researchers used to explore a challenge,
and there are many (Table 1). The tools in basic biology and ecology
relevant to environmental management can be reproducible it at least
conceptually, they can be replicated in another system or applied to
similar challenge - i.e.~citizen science as a means to collect
environmental data {[}26{]} is relevant to many of the challenges we
face including global warming, water quality, and declining
biodiversity.

\textbf{9. Link the primary reproducible tool to the outcome.} The tool
can provide a means to collect data, detect patterns, directly solve an
environmental challenge, or inform policy. If the paper was a direct
test of basic ecology for an environmental challenge, this can be very
straightforward. For instance, ``Odonata (Insecta) as a tool for the
bio-monitoring of environmental quality'' {[}27{]} clearly provides a
means to measure and detect. However, the other proposed roles can
address challenges in a diversity of ways. The identification of or
provision of research evidence is the most ``basic'' role, and it is
also likely the most typical in ecology. Tools that can function in this
capacity include surveys, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, citizen
science data collection, mapping, open-access data, modelling to predict
changes. Tests in the second category directly examine the efficacy of a
management strategy or intervention. Tools that could play this role
include bio-monitoring, mitigation and remediation experiments, and
population demography studies. The inform policy research is typically
more indirect and synthetic. They often take the form of anthropocentric
studies that consider ecological or environmental policy. Any of the
above tools can serve this role, but some tools fit most squarely in
this role include economic incentivization models ({[}28{]}), human
health impact studies {[}29{]}, and human well-being monitoring
associated with environmental interventions {[}30{]}.

\textbf{10. Apply the tool to another challenge or explain how it is
generalizable.} This principle proposes that the primary tool is
reproducible if it can be applied to another challenge or context. It
ties together the concept that reverse-engineered reproducible solutions
are relevant to more than the unpacked, single environmental management
challenge case. This can promote increased in efficiency for tackling
novel environmental challenges as they emerge, and it also supports the
overarching philosophy here for basic science that we cannot continue to
ignore reuse given the global environmental needs for better decision
making.

\section{Implications}\label{implications}

At its core, these principles can distribute the burden of scientific
communication between scientists and stakeholders and embodies a spirit
of dialog between senders and receivers (or between producers and
consumers). Reuse is also not the sole criterion for useful science nor
should it be. Professional advocacy and knowledge mobilization are
increasingly important priorities for universities and science in
general {[}31{]}. Evidence-based decision making is a critical area for
growth and knowledge in many disciplines {[}32--34{]} - not just
environmental management. Increased consumption of scientific evidence
by managers and basic science that is more palatable to a broader
audience written by researchers will result in increased functional use
of scientific literature. Collaboration with stakeholders will
facilitate this process, and open science will be pivotal.
