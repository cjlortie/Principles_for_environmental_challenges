\section*{Abstract}
An environmental management challenge is an opportunity to use
fundamental science to inform evidence-based decisions for environmental
stakeholders and conservationists. Contemporary science is embracing
open science and increasingly conscious of reproduciblility.
Synergistically, applying these two paradigms in concert advances our
capacity to move beyond context dependency and singlular thinking to
reverse engineer solutions from published scientific evidence associated
with one challenge to many. Herein, we provide a short list of
principles that can guide those that seek solutions to address
environmental management through primary scientific literature.

cannot neglect fundamental science as a substrate for effective decision
making, and scientists should be conscious of how their science can be

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Conservation decisions can reside with legislators (indirect impactors)
or environmental managers (direct impactors). To focus on the latter,
managers typically have scientific backgrounds and routinely navigate
the technical literature. However, engagement with scientific literature
is non-trivial for all practitioners because of time, access, relevance
of the science, and reporting standards. Environmental managers and
conservationist are certainly seeking evidence to inform decisions
(citations please). However, there can be a gap in communication between
basic science and management for at least three reasons. Firstly, the
research is not a direct study of an ecosystem, and an immediate,
real-world solution is needed by managers - preferably with a
demonstrable outcome and reasonable cost estimate (citations). This is a
very real limitation in the primary science literature restoration
ecology for instance (cite Lortie better late than never). Secondly, the
link between the biology or ecology present in the literature is not
articulately connected to the similar process for the system at hand.
There are notable examples with journals just as the Journal of Applied
Ecology, Basic and Applied Ecology, the Journal of Environmental
Engineering, and many others, but there nonetheless remains a vast pool
of opportunity for solution development in other journals.
Context-specific findings in science are a legimitate and useful means
to advance discovery, but at times, studies from one system can be
repurposed for insights into another. Finally, the capacity to see the
forest for the trees or the generality of a specific, even large-scale
or broad basic research study can be a challenge. Science can be very
specialized (citation to Nancy Baron book), and mobilizing knowledge for
solutions requires both detailed expertise, scientific synthesis tools
(cite to Lortie formalized synthesis paper in Oikos), or a focus on
identifying the salient elements associated with a study (citation).
Often, seeing the forest also requires sampling many trees. This leads
to the general proposal here that experts can promote reproducible and
mobile knowledge for many fundamental science endeavors by considering
these principles. This is both a set of principles for how to make your
research potentially reusable by environmental managers and
conservationists (citation to get your paper used by meta) and inform
solutions for the environmental crisis.

An environmental management challenge is a problem presented in
scientific literature or society that, when redefined and reviewed using
these 10 principles, can result in a solution to the original problem.
EXPAND\ldots{} a tiny bit more..how. Typically, a challenge is\ldots{}.
look up how they define grand challenges and make mention here including
the 17 global sustainability goals. A (reverse-engineered) reproducible
solution is a suggested solution to a challenge derived from identifying
all the components of the challenge. It should be applicable to multiple
local-extent challenges when tweaked to fit the circumstances. Finally,
a tool or solution is the desired outcome from the primary research to
support evidence-based decision making in conservation. In this case, a
tool is a methodology researchers use that can faciitate managers to
either identify best ways to measure/identify issues or to provide
solutions for their specific challenge. Any tool is linked to its
respective reproducible solution by the fundamental concepts of
reproducibility (citation to reproducibility crisis paper). These can
include primarily conceptual replication but also\ldots{}. check papers
on reproducibility. then concluding sentence.

Inspired by the ``Ten Simple Rules'' format pioneered by Phillip Bourne
in the field of computational biology {[}1{]}; we propose that by
distilling the concepts that promote engagement with scientific
literature outside of the research community, managers can rely on
broader sources of scientific knowledge to make decisions. Additionally,
researchers can better understand the perspective of managers
facilitating science and scientific communication that is more
applicable to managers without compromising their interests. Here, we
will outline and discuss simple ``principles'' scientists can use to
make their research more applicable to managers, and managers can use to
identify basic science that fits their needs.

\section{The principles}\label{the-principles}

\textbf{1. Reframe the problem as challenge.} Doom-and-gloom is a
pervasive mentality in ecology and environmental sciences which can
reduce productivity and problem solving. It can shut down even the most
motivated of minds--but beyond the issue of motivation, reframing a
problem as a \emph{challenge} can reveal avenues of solutions that may
otherwise remain hidden. For example, consider the problem of
human-wildlife conflict between carnivores and the people living near
the Ruaha National Park boundary in Tanzania. The \emph{problem} is that
98.5\% of people perceive wildlife as a threat to their livestock,
resulting in increased opportunity for human-wildlife conflict {[}2{]}.
Rephrased, the challenge might be: how can we decrease negative
perception of wildlife in areas with high human-wildlife conflict
opportunity? It's a small change in syntax, but a huge change in
directional thought. This perspective is also the most compatible format
to devise a solution using the following principles.

\textbf{2. Describe the scope and extent of the challenge.} Often
necessary when writing grants, the ability to define the scope of the
challenge will make identifying an appropriate solution easier. The
challenge can exist on a local, regional, or global scale. While many
studies perform their observations or experiments on a sample area, the
challenge associated with their findings extends beyond the region of
interest in the study. In our human-wildlife conflict example, the scope
of the study itself is of local interest to the area surrounding the
Southern border of the Ruaha National Park, but because human-wildlife
conflict exists in all parts of the world, the extent of the challenge
is global.

\textbf{3. Explicitly link the basic science to management implications
and policy.} Before trying to identify a solution, one must have a full
grasp of how the results of a study could impact management strategy or
legislative action. For example, depredation of livestock impacted
61.1\% of households in our example challenge, but was less responsible
for livestock loss than disease or theft. Knowing the widespread, but
shallow nature of the problem should influence managers to consider
making any solutions available to all people threatened by depredation.
This is perhaps the most obvious principle, but also one of the most
essential to defining a solution using \emph{basic scientific evidence}.

\textbf{4. Propose implications of ignoring this challenge.} This
principle is perhaps the best tool when advocating for the
implementation of a solution. Being able to describe the impact the
challenge could have on a system (if left unchecked) will help clarify
the severity of the challenge. Will this problem, left to fester, have
minimal or severe consequences? And on what scale will it affect a
system? Where will we and the ecosystem in question end up? Knowing the
answers to these questions will help develop a reasonable solution that
fits the challenge. In our human-wildlife conflict example,
anti-carnivore sentiment will likely only grow as climate change and
pressures to confine pastoral herders makes livestock more difficult to
raise {[}3{]}; {[}4{]}. Considering that many large carnivores are
already threatened/endangered, further anthropogenic pressures on the
populations could lead to severe declines in populations, or even the
extinction of keystone species. This problem can be found across the
globe wherever humans and animals are found coexisting {[}5{]}; {[}6{]};
{[}7{]} but is often associated with underlying human-human conflict
{[}8{]}.

\textbf{5. State the direct human needs associated with this challenge.}
To expand on principle 4, considering the direct needs of humans is an
essential part of the process. Conservationists have a tendency to react
sentimentally, considering the intrinsic value of the ecosystem and its
right to exist. This is valid, and should not be overlooked. However, it
is all too easy for those who value ``nature'' to dismiss ecosystem
services. Identifying anthropogenic needs will help a problem solver
create a solution that is appropriate for the challenge, and prevent the
manifestation of new challenges. To bring it back to our human-wildlife
conflict challenge, a direct need of humans in the Ruaha region is to
have livestock with which to make a living. It is true that a solution
\emph{could} be to remove livestock; that way, the carnivores will no
longer be seen as predators of non-existent livestock. Obviously, this
is not a viable solution as the humans interacting within this system
will suffer, rendering the solution unethical and unsustainable. The
error in this example may seem obvious, but explicitly identifying all
needs associated with a challenge will help organize the problem-solving
process, and prevent any potential missteps. It is always a good idea to
ask the group affected--particularly if they are a marginalized
group--what their direct needs are as well.

\textbf{6. List at least one limitation of the study and explain.} While
the peer review process should eliminate any poorly executed science,
nearly all studies have some limitation. Critically reading the study
associated with the challenge can mean the difference between success
and failure of a later implemented management solution that otherwise
follows all other principles presented. For example, conflating
causation with correlation can be a fatal misstep if making real-world
decisions based on a correlated trend. However, it's an unfortunate
truth that conservationists and managers often have to make decisions on
a real-world challenge without fully understanding the system in which
they work, since a solution is often needed immediately in order to
prevent a catastrophic loss. Still, knowing the relative strength of a
solution can help prepare for a range of outcomes. Perhaps the most
important step, however, is to identify limitations of the study in
order to best advocate for an eventual solution's implementation. Being
well versed in counter-arguments is essential in any debate, and it is
no different when advocating for a solution.

\textbf{7. Explore the benefits of minimal intervention for
stakeholders.} The culmination of principles of 4, 5, and 6, principle 7
is another idea that can feel uncomfortable to a traditional
conservationist. Why not just do \emph{everything} so that all our bases
are covered? Unfortunately, resources to conserve the environment are
limited, and managers must maximize their ``profits'' (positive
restoration/conservation outcomes). Ideally, a well-designed solution
takes minimal resource allocation, and has minimal incidental negative
effects.

\textbf{8. List the tools applied to this challenge.} This principle is
most critical for researchers wishing to make their science more
amenable to management use, but is also helpful to managers seeking
relevant papers beyond studies which focus specifically on their
projects. In an environmental management challenge case study, there is
usually one primary tool the researchers use to produce their results.
However, there can be many more than one! These tools usually take the
form of common methodologies that can be used across sub-disciplines,
and are easily identifiable. Look to the methods to identify these
tools. Some examples of primary tools we have found include:
\emph{meta-analysis {[}9{]}; {[}10{]} }systematic review {[}11{]}
\emph{citizen science {[}12{]}; {[}13{]} }team science {[}14{]} \emph{R
{[}15{]} }mapping {[}16{]} \emph{big data/open access databases
{[}17{]}; {[}18{]}; {[}19{]} }modelling {[}20{]} \emph{surveys {[}21{]}
}biomonitoring {[}22{]} \emph{evolutionary change/population viability
genetic analysis {[}23{]} }economic incentivization monitoring {[}24{]}
*human health and well-being monitoring {[}25{]}; {[}2{]} This list
could potentially be expanded upon, and new tools can result in new
solutions.

\textbf{9. Explain the role that the primary tool addressed for the
challenge--i.e.~identification/research evidence, management/solution
applied, or inform policy.} Continuing from principle 8, this principle
focuses on which tool used in a study is primarily responsible for
producing results. A good place to start may be the tile, as often a
tool will be highlighted; for example, ``Odonata (Insecta) as a tool for
the bio-monitoring of environmental quality'' {[}22{]}. After
identifying which tool is primary, consider the role that tool could
play in finding the solution to the challenge. Three examples of roles a
tool could play are: \emph{identification/research evidence} which seeks
to better our understanding of systems so that we may more effectively
manage them. It is the most ``pure'' role of tools in basic science, and
is also the most common in typical ecology papers. Tools that could play
this role include surveys, meta analysis, team science, systematic
review, citizen science, R, mapping, open access databases, modelling.
\emph{management/solution applied} which observes the effectiveness of
management strategies. Tools that could play this role include
bio-monitoring and evolutionary change/population viability genetic
analysis. \emph{inform policy} which seeks to help legislators make
decisions about environmental challenges. They often take the form of
anthropocentric studies that consider ecological or environmental
policy. Any tool could play this role, but some tools which fit most
neatly into this role include economic incentivization monitoring and
human health and well-being monitoring. Depending on how a tool is used,
these tools may play multiple roles in a solution, or may play an
entirely different role than described. Most importantly, the primary
tool's role informs the direction our solution should take, based on our
challenge study.

\textbf{10. Apply the tool to another challenge or explain how it is
general and scaleable.} Finally, use the primary tool explored in
principle 9 to broaden the applicability of the challenge's solution.
This principle ties together the idea that reverse-engineered
reproducible solutions are relevant to more than just the environmental
management challenge case unpacked. After doing all this work, it makes
sense to seek and understand its reproducibility for future work! Beyond
efficiency, it also addresses the key challenge we are trying to address
through these principles: Basic science can be more applicable than it
sometimes appears.

\section{Implications}\label{implications}

At its core, our 10 principles for reverse-engineering solutions to
solve environmental challenges are guidelines to improve science
communication. Usually, when we talk about sci comm, the burden of
effective communication is on the researcher or advocate (because
usually we are directing our sci comm at general audiences who are not
obligated to give the researcher their attention). But in animal
behavior, communication requires at least two parties: a \emph{sender}
and a \emph{reciever}. In this instance, the researcher is a sender and
the manager is the receiver. For this communication to be successful,
both parties must actively participate in this reuse of solutions from
one domain to another. Luckily, both parties in our scenario have
incentive to engage with effective communication. Professional advocacy
is a common priority for ecologists, who hope their work influences
better decision-making of both indirect and direct impactors. And
managers, of course, wish to improve their project outcomes. Increased
consumption of scientific evidence by managers, and basic science that
is more palatable to a broader audience written by researchers, will
result in \emph{functional use of scientific literature}. Overall,
better collaboration will encourage the realization of the common goal:
solving an environmental management challenge.
